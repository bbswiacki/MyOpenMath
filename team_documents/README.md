#MyOpenMath

##Compared to Other Programs

MyOpenMath is open source educational software free to use by students and teachers, and it also links with open source textbooks.  This software is designed to be an open source and free alternative to paid math lab software and textbooks.  
	
	
When comparing MyOpenMath to other software, like Person’s MyMathLab, when it comes to price and budget, it saves the school or students about $120 per person per year for the program alone.  When you factor in the textbook that goes along with it that is also open source, it saves the school or student about $250 per student.  That is $250 per student that can be put back into other programs or directed to other needs of the student.  That could be $5,000 of savings for one semester for the school.   


When it comes to curriculum, MyOpenMath is nearly identical to its for profit counterparts.  Both of the programs offers very similar learning options including quizzes, tests, tutorials, lecture videos, and homework solutions.  They are both based off of textbooks with the same material teaching the same concepts. The one main difference is that with MyOpenMath, the instructor can create the content instead of it all being included by the software, this adds personalization for each specific class or teacher.  


In general the programs are similar and equally as useful in the education system.  The MyOpenMath program is very simple to use and seems to have a lower learning curve for students and instructors to overcome.  Overall the one main reason to use MyOpenMath is because of how much money will be saved by using this free service.

#Part 2 - Talking Points
###Laura:
 
"My Open Math’s website criteria delivers the availability to adopt an online textbook, with valuable, online interactive homework, with no additional fees, which offers homework with immediate feedback provided, quizzes, and tests with rich mathematical content, as well as a full course management system including file postings, discussion forums, videos, handouts, instructor resources, and a full grade book, while also providing the available classroom options of a web enhancement of an on-campus course, an added feature to a hybrid course, a fully online course, and an individual self- study course. 

As a whole, My Open Math delivers free hosted use of the open-source platform ImathAS, through free, open textbooks on OpenTextBookStore.com, while also providing free classroom use of the platform through the available course templates of algebra, pre-calculus, college algebra, calculus, math for liberal arts, and statistics, as well as delivering community-based support through open support forums and training videos, and offering availability of comprehensive support for MyOpenMath through Lumen Learning. 

My Open Math’s web site ergonomics delivers website efficiency through effectively clear and organized content, easy navigation and orientation use through individual, distinct sections with bold titles, and easy methods of returning to the home page, and lastly, positive visual aspects and legibility through easy to read, visually identifying components through simply printed content, direct text lines, and dramatic visual contrasts among different parts of the site, such as bolding effects among each important subject division."

	
###Anna:

"The lesson plans that would be made to use with MyOpenMath would be very straightforward and easy to follow. We created one that went through chapter one of college algebra. By using this website, almost all of your resources would be on the site. The book, video lessons, homework, and test reviews would all be on this website. Students would also have fast and easy access to these tools. This lesson plan is just an example of the many ways you can teach MyOpenMath, and as you can see, it is very simple. Using this website gives you a guide to follow because it splits up the chapters into sections. Each section has a video lesson to go with it, and each chapter has problems for the student to answer for homework. Practice test problems are also available for the students to work on. All of these aspects make teaching using MyOpenMath very easy and successful."
