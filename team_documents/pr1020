Oct. 20th


##Team Accomplishments:
We successfully collaborated on Part 1 of the project and assigned roles for Part 2, the multi media project.


##Unfinished Tasks:
Today in class we are dividing up work for our script and PowerPoint for part 2 which we hope to have done by Sunday.

Laura was not here on Tuesday, but she submitted her work on time.

##Late Status Reports:
All team members are present today.
