Anticipated Concerns
Ensuring everyone maintains their role and contributes to the project

Conflict Resolution
We intend to avoid conflict by collaborating. Whether it be in person or via email, text, etc. all group members will stay up to date on the current workload. Should a member miss a class period they will be required to contact the project manager. Should we come across a conflict that we can not resolve we will be sure to present both sides to the instructor for his decision.

Unacceptable Work
Should a team member submit unfit work the team member should discuss with the project manager or have a collaborative meeting with the entire team and submit a revised form of the work within 24 hours.
