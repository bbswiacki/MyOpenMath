	I think the project is going well, there was a little confusion as to what was due this week if
  it was a rough draft or a proposal.  I am still confused as to how the technical portion of it 
  works when it comes to the Github and markdown syntax stuff.  I am also confused about how the 
  virtual studio code program works and what the usefulness of it is.  I think as the project continues
  it will get easier and less confusing.

Everything with the project is going great so far. We have gotten everything turned in, and everyone
is working really well together. There was a little bit of confusion with the rough draft, though. 
We werenâ€™t completely sure if it was a rough draft or a proposal due. Our group got everything figured out,
and split up the rough draft into parts. Each team member has had a role in every part of this project, and 
everyone has been doing his or her parts.

The project is going well. I think it has been difficult to do our screencasts for the multi media part. However,
I am very "tech-savvy" so I am sure we can figure it out. I am getting used to GitHub so formating our work is getting easier.
Laura was not here today, but submitted her work on time and is keeping up with the group.
