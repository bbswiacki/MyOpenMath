Team Accomplishments:

We successfully chose our team project, which will be presenting a tutorial to teachers about how to operate and navigate the mathematical educational website, My Open Math. My Open Math is a website that offers free access to math software programs. We also successfully created a dated team charter with assigned tasks, such as project creation days, implementations, revisions, etc. To add, we also created desired goals such as successfully learning about My Open Math and successfully accomplishing a thorough and effective tutorial for our targeted audience of primarily teachers, but also students as well. Lastly, group members assumed and chose certain roles within the group, such as leader, researcher, secretary, and head revisionist. 

Unfinished Tasks:

We are currently up to speed within everything of our task schedule and nothing is incomplete as of now. 

Schedule Revisions:

As of right now, we have not had any schedule changes and we have successfully followed the first schedule that we created. 

Group Problems: 

As far as any problems, there have not been any among group members or problems with working collaboratively, however, there have been some minor technical problems, such as navigating the github site, as it is slightly confusing.

Late Status Reports:

As of now, none of the group members have failed at successfully communicating or completing their assigned tasks. Everyone is working very well collaboratively, as well as individually, and all work is being contributed equally.
